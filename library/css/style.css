Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.

Stylesheet: Base Mobile Stylesheet

Be light and don't over style since everything here will be
loaded by mobile devices. You want to keep it as minimal as
possible. This is called at the top of the main stylsheet
and will be used across all viewports.

  This stylesheet is loaded for larger devices. It's set to
  481px because at 480px it would load on a landscaped iPhone.
  This isn't ideal because then you would be loading all those
  extra styles on that same mobile connection.
  
  A word of warning. This size COULD be a larger mobile device,
  so you still want to keep it pretty light and simply expand
  upon your base.scss styles.

  Stylesheet: Retina Screens & Devices Stylesheet
  
  When handling retina screens you need to make adjustments, especially
  if you're not using font icons. Here you can add them in one neat
  place.
  
  ******************************************************************/
  /* 
  
  EXAMPLE 
  Let's say you have an image and you need to make sure it looks ok
  on retina screens. Let's say we have an icon which dimension are
  24px x 24px. In your regular stylesheets, it would look something
  like this:
  
  .icon {
  	width: 24px;
  	height: 24px;
  	background: url(img/test.png) no-repeat;
  }
  
  For retina screens, we have to make some adjustments, so that image
  doesn't look blurry. So, taking into account the image above and the
  dimensions, this is what we would put in our retina stylesheet:
  
  .icon {
  	background: url(img/test@2x.png) no-repeat;
  	background-size: 24px 24px;
  }
  
  So, you would create the same icon, but at double the resolution, meaning 
  it would be 48px x 48px. You'd name it the same, but with a @2x at the end
  (this is pretty standard practice). Set the background image so it matches
  the original dimensions and you are good to go.
